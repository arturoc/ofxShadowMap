Not so pretty hacks/bug fixes/work arounds for Windows OF 0.9.8 were implemented.  
The ***master** branch* is compatible to that of the original, which depends on Mac OF 0.10.X.  
***Windows_OF_0.9.8** branch* will clean out OF 0.10.X codes and implement new and clean APIs dedicated for OF 0.9.8.  

Shadow map using PCF or gaussian disk sampling for soft borders.  
This openFrameworks addon allows to render shadows using ofMaterial and ofLight. Right now only 1 directional light is supported. In the future this might become part of the core materials allowing more lights and light types.
